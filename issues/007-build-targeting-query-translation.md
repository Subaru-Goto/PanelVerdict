## Goal

Natural-language target description → **structured SQL filters + embedding query** (self-query / query translation — this IS the "advanced RAG" requirement).

- hybrid retrieval: SQL for hard attributes, vector for fuzzy attributes,
- panel sampling: 100–300 personas, ~80–90% target-matched + 10–20% random **control group**,
- **fixed seed** → reproducible panels.
